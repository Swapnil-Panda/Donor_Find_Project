    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "-Random Forest is believed to be one of the best ensemble classifiers for high-dimensional data. One real world application of random forest classifier is weather prediction. Different meterological and weather based data are collected and random forest classifier is used. Its accuracy is increased with the number of data collected.\n",
    "-Random forest runtimes are quite fast, and they are able to deal with unbalanced and missing data. Random Forest algorithm performs well when the number of dataset is high or number of parameters is large.\n",
    "-Its weaknesses are RF classifiers sometimes overfits for noisy data\n",
    "-The random forest is a model made up of many decision trees. Rather than just simply averaging the prediction of dfferent trees, this model uses two key concepts that gives it the name random:\n",
    "i)Random sampling of training data points when building trees\n",
    "ii)Random subsets of features considered when splitting nodes\n",
    "As in the ML dataset there were 103 parameters we chose Random Forest to be one of our testing algorithms.\n",
    "** Naive Bayes\n",
    "-Naïve Bayes is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. One real world application of Naïve Bayes Algorithm is spam detection. It works with words and as long as it is kept simple, it can go through data and find spam mails quite easily and quickly. Its accuracy is higher than more complex models in spam detection.\n",
    "-Naïve Bayes is fast. That’s why it can outperform many complex models when working with very large datasets.  It proves to be quite robust to irrelevant features, which it ignores. It learns and predicts very fast and it does not require lots of storage. \n",
    "-The greatest weakness of the naïve Bayes classifier is that it relies on an often-faulty assumption of equally important and independent features which results in biased posterior probabilities. NB has high bais and low variance. Hence it makes its application limited. Having said this there are no regularization or hyperparmeters tuning involved here to adjust the bias thing.\n",
    "-In the CharityML problem the dataset was quite big and there were few irrelevant parameters. And most parametres were independent of each other. Naïve Bayes is good for classification. So I used NB to as a testing algorithm.\n",
    "** Adaboost Classifier\n",
    "-AdaBoost can be used to solve a variety of real-world problems, such as predicting customer churn and classifying the types of topics customers are talking/calling about. The algorithm is heavily utilised for solving classification problems.\n",
    "-Advantages of adaboost are :Very good use of weak classifiers for cascading; Different classification algorithms can be used as weak classifiers; AdaBoost has a high degree of precision; Relative to the bagging algorithm and Random Forest Algorithm, AdaBoost fully considers the weight of each classifier;\n",
    "-Weakness of adaboost are: The number of AdaBoost iterations is also a poorly set number of weak classifiers, which can be determined using cross-validation; Data imbalance leads to a decrease in classification accuracy; Training is time consuming, and it is best to cut the point at each reselection of the current classifier\n",
    "-In the charityML problem we needed higher precision. Adaboost model can provide us that, also this model is highly customizable so we can tweak these features and utilize all of our parameters fully. So AdaBoost model was picked.\n",

    "The three models I trained were Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier and Naive Bayes(Multinomial). From the graph we can see that F score for the testing set was highest for Naive Bayes Algorithm.For Random Forest and AdaBoost F score was almost same. In case of accuracy adaboost had the advantage. If we check the time for model training and predicting, Naive Bayes needed the smallest time period and beat other algorithms by a large margin. Adaboost took a long time for both training and predicting.\n",

    "The final model which was best suited for work was Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm. It works on Bayes theorem, but it makes a naive prediction that every parameter is independent. Bayes theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. It revises an existing probabilty of an occurence based on some prior knowledge. And in Naive Bayes we assume all conditions are independent.\n",
    "In the given data there were 13 parameters, we assumed all of the 13 parameters are independent of each other and predicted the probability of a person earning more than 50K based on only a single parameter at a time. Then we multiplied all of these probabilities together to make a prediction with the full data.These naive assumption is almost always wrong but the overall evaluation showed the Naive Bayes algorithm outperformed all other complex algorithms and predicts data at the fastest speed. Thus we picked Naive Bayes algorithm."

This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.

Amazingly accuracy did not reduce by much.That means the data underfitted with reduced data points. This wasexpected for Naive Bayes. As it simplifies the data and makes them independent, too few features makes them underfit reducing precision and recall.\n",
